# My Simple Page

## Overview
This project is a minimal static webpage that displays a title and a single paragraph of text:
- Title: "My Simple Page"
- Paragraph: "This was generated by my application."

## Setup
No build tools or dependencies are required.
- Option 1: Double-click index.html to open it in your default browser.
- Option 2: Serve it locally (optional) with any static server, e.g.:
  - Python: python3 -m http.server and visit http://localhost:8000
  - Node (serve): npx serve . and visit the printed URL

## Usage
Open index.html in any modern web browser. You will see the page title at the top and a single paragraph of text below it.

## Improvements from previous version (Round 2)
- Added responsive, accessible typography and spacing for better readability across devices.
- Applied light/dark mode support using prefers-color-scheme and CSS variables.
- Ensured semantic structure with main and h1, and set the document <title> for better accessibility and bookmarking.
- Kept content strictly to one paragraph below the title as specified, with cleaner styling and layout.
